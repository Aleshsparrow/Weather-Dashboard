# Weather-Dashboard-Homework
As a web developer, I work with a lot of clients and sometimes I am required to travel to different cities. I created this web app to help me better prepare for my travels. I also optimized this app so it can be used accross all devices. 

The weather information was gotten from Open Weather API.

    I started out by sketching my intended design on a notepad and adding all the major components, classes, id's and the correct tags to use.

    I completed the interactive part with Jquerry and appended the weather data I got from Open Weather API to page,so it can be displayed when a city is typed in.
